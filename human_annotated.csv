section 3,"This work considers a new few-shot meta-RL setting, where the agent does not observe rewards during its few shots on a new task, but instead submits pairs of trajectories to a preference oracle, which returns which of the two trajectories is preferred (i.e., would achieve higher returns). The idea is that querying a preference oracle may require less supervision than obtaining reward labels on these trajectories. Then, to solve this setting, this work proposes a new method for task inference, where a preference predictor is learned to imitate the preference oracle, and then the task is inferred by performing an error-tolerant form of binary search with the preference predictor: the idea is to find a task under which the preference predictor most agrees with the preference oracle. This work evaluates the proposed method on standard MuJoCo meta-RL tasks, where only the reward function changes between tasks, and finds that the proposed method outperforms vanilla PEARL (which is not designed to handle this setting). Furthermore, the experiments show that adding error tolerance to the binary search procedure is important when the oracle includes noise.",,,
section 4,"I'd like to recommend including real-human experiments. Because real humans can show various irrationality and have an inductive bias in decision making, the trends on real humans can be different from synthetic preferences. Therefore, it would be nice if the authors could include real human experiments.",,,
